## Grabber

Grabs .mp3 files from a given Apache Index Directory
#How to Use:
You'll need python installed, so go install it.
Then, run 'python grabber.py'

Or, open it up in IDLE and compile (on Windows)

###To Do
Find more Apache Index Directories
Add Soundcloud API support (to search soundcloud)
Find a way to access sites whose directories' indexes are not available (might be kinda hard)
Use a better data structure to store the mp3s (linear search bads).
